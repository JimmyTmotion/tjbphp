He was very clear what each level of his service offered and once he understood my context, he made great suggestions as to what would be the best approach.\n\nHe also went far above what I asked for and the delivered work is stellar. This was an unplanned and significant investment for me, but Tom's work is extremely professional and the value totally worth it. Highly recommend Tom for your next project."
